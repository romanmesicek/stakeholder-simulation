- More agricultural base, lower incomes
- Poverty rate: 18% (vs. 12% in Northern Town)
- Indigenous community: 3,000 people with distinct needs
- Renewable potential: Excellent wind and solar resources
- Tourism potential if environmental restoration successful

**Community Assets:**

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What You Control:**
- Social license: Renewable projects need community acceptance—opposition can delay or prevent development
- Permitting influence: Local councils affect planning approvals
- Political connections: Direct access to regional/national representatives
- Land: Strategic sites for wind and solar installations
- Local knowledge: Understanding of development opportunities and community needs
- Media access: Ability to shape public narrative
- Coalition strength: Represent diverse interests showing broad support

**What You Can Offer:**
- Prime sites for renewable facilities (70-80% of capacity sited locally)

- Fast-track permitting and approvals
- Available workforce and infrastructure
- Political support for company policies
- Tourism promotion of renewable developments

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Tax Revenue Replacement**
Cannot accept severe public service cuts. School closure politically and ethically unacceptable. Emergency service reductions endanger safety. Require: €8 million annual revenue replacement OR equivalent service funding for 10 years minimum.

**Local Renewable Siting**
Cannot accept community burdens without community benefits. Minimum 70% of renewable capacity must be sited locally. Provides: construction jobs, operational positions, local tax revenue. Principle: Communities hosting plants should host clean energy.

**Economic Development Fund**
Minimum €250 million for business attraction and diversification. Token gestures inadequate for genuine economic transition. Transparent governance with community representation. Binding commitment, not vague promises.

**Youth Opportunity Programs**
Concrete programs with measurable commitments. Training slots, scholarships, apprenticeships with defined numbers. Cannot sacrifice next generation's future.

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Economic multiplier: Northern Plant closure eliminates €45 million payroll supporting 180 businesses = 750 total jobs at risk
- Tax crisis: €8 million loss = 35% of municipal budget; requires either devastating cuts or 60% property tax increase on remaining residents
- Property wealth: Values declined 15%; rapid closure could trigger 30-40% drops wiping out €180 million household wealth
- Renewable potential: Communities have superior wind/solar resources (95th percentile nationally)
- Comparative justice: German coal regions received €40 billion support; Scottish communities got infrastructure investments
- Training assets: Technical training center ready for renewable energy curriculum
- Political reality: 15,000 voters in Northern Town + 8,000 in Southern Region = critical swing constituencies

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU

**Best outcome:** €300 million community economic development fund. 80% renewable capacity sited locally (1,000+ construction jobs; 250 permanent jobs). Tax revenue replacement for 10 years. €50 million infrastructure investment (broadband, industrial park, facilities). Youth programs for 250 participants. 7-8 year timeline enabling economic adjustment. Communities positioned as regional renewable energy hub.

**Acceptable outcome:** €200 million community fund. 65% renewable capacity local siting. Tax support for 7 years. €30 million infrastructure investment. Youth programs for 150 participants. 6-7 year timeline. Economic diversification trajectory established. Public services maintained.

**Failure to avoid:** Community fund under €100 million (token gesture). Minimal local renewable siting (costs without benefits). Inadequate tax replacement forcing school closures. Timeline under 6 years forcing rushed adjustment. No youth programs (abandoning next generation). Community economic collapse creating ghost towns.
