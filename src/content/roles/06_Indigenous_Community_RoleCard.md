# Indigenous Community
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent the Indigenous community of approximately 3,000 members whose traditional lands surround the Southern Plant. Your delegation includes the Tribal Council Chair, Elder Advisory representative, Environmental Stewardship Director, Youth Council spokesperson, and Economic Development Officer.

**Your authority:** Constitutionally recognized Indigenous rights, established land claims, international human rights frameworks (UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples), traditional governance structures, legal standing for environmental claims, capacity to pursue litigation and permit challenges.

**Who you represent:** 3,000 community members, elders holding traditional knowledge, youth seeking economic opportunity, future generations who will inherit this land, the river ecosystem central to your culture.

### YOUR SITUATION

**Historical Harm:**
- Southern Plant built in 1990 with minimal Indigenous consultation
- 35 years of thermal discharge raised river temperature 5-8°C
- Mercury contamination: 300% above safe limits for fish consumption
- Traditional fishing—your people's primary protein source for millennia—no longer safe
- Sacred sites along riverbank near plant operations
- Air pollution: respiratory illness rates 23% above regional average

**Community Demographics:**
- Population: 3,000 members; 45% under age 30; 18% over 60
- Unemployment: 35% (vs 8% regional average)
- Median income: 60% of regional average
- 90 community members work at Southern Plant (18% of workforce)

**Renewable Opportunity:**
- Your territory has exceptional wind/solar resources (95th percentile nationally)
- Potential 200+ MW renewable capacity on traditional land
- Development requires your cooperation or faces legal challenges

---

### YOUR PRIMARY GOALS

**1. Comprehensive River and Environmental Restoration**
- Complete cessation of thermal discharge within 3 years
- Mercury remediation to levels safe for fish consumption
- Fish population restoration with Indigenous-defined success metrics
- Sacred site protection with legally enforceable buffer zones
- Minimum €60 million restoration budget with Indigenous oversight
- 20-year post-closure monitoring program

**2. Meaningful Economic Participation Through Ownership**
- Minimum 25% Indigenous ownership stake in renewable facilities on your territory
- 100 guaranteed jobs for community members (construction + permanent)
- Skills training with 150 placement commitments
- Revenue sharing: €5 million annually to community
- Youth apprenticeship program with 50 positions

**3. Indigenous Rights Recognition and Consent**

- Indigenous representation on transition governance structures
- Cultural impact assessment for proposed facilities

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What You Control:**
- Legal rights: Constitutional protections, treaty obligations, international frameworks
- Consultation requirements: Legal obligation for meaningful consultation—failure creates permit vulnerability
- Strategic location: Optimal renewable sites lie within your territory
- Traditional ecological knowledge: Generations of ecosystem understanding
- Moral authority: Public sympathy for Indigenous environmental justice

**What You Can Offer:**
- Land access for renewable development
- Community acceptance enabling smooth permitting
- Workforce for construction and operations
- Traditional knowledge for environmental restoration
- Positive narrative for company ESG reporting

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**River Restoration Commitment**
Cannot accept any agreement without comprehensive, funded, Indigenous-supervised river restoration.

**Meaningful Ownership Stake**
Token benefit sharing or employment-only arrangements unacceptable. Require genuine ownership (minimum 20%).

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent**
Will not accept developments imposed without genuine consent processes.

**Sacred Site Protection**
Absolute protection of identified sacred sites. No facilities within designated cultural protection zones.

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- "UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires free, prior, and informed consent. This government endorsed it."
- "35 years of pollution destroyed our traditional food sources. Mercury poisoned our fish."
- "Respiratory illness in our community is 23% above regional average. Our children bear health consequences."
- "Our territory has 95th percentile wind and solar resources. Development will happen. The question is whether we participate as owners."
- "90 of our members already work at Southern Plant. We have the skills. Invest in us."
- "We are not going anywhere. Our community will remain on this land regardless of what you decide."

---

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Best outcome:** 30% Indigenous ownership stake generating €8 million annual revenue. €80 million comprehensive river restoration achieving fishable river within 7 years. 120 permanent jobs + 200 training graduates. Full FPIC protocol. €50 million community benefit fund.

**Acceptable outcome:** 25% ownership generating €6 million annually. €60 million restoration with Indigenous monitoring. 90 jobs + 150 training positions. FPIC commitment for major developments. €30 million community benefit fund.

**Failure to avoid:** Token ownership (<15%) without governance rights. Inadequate restoration leaving river degraded. Employment-only benefits without lasting community wealth. Imposed decisions without Indigenous participation.

### USEFUL PHRASES FOR NEGOTIATION

- "Our people have lived on this land for thousands of years—long before coal plants, before this company, before the governments here today existed..."
- "The river you call a 'cooling system' we call the life-giver. It sustained our ancestors. It should sustain our grandchildren."
- "Development on our territory requires our partnership or faces legal challenge. Courts increasingly recognize Indigenous rights. Choose partnership..."
- "We're not asking for charity—we're offering partnership. Our land, your capital, shared prosperity."
- "Restoration. Ownership. Employment. Rights. These are our requirements. The river's health and our community's future are not negotiable."
