# PowerShift Energy Management
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You are the executive leadership team of PowerShift Energy making decisions about transitioning from coal to renewable energy. Your team includes the CEO, CFO, Chief Operations Officer, and Head of Corporate Social Responsibility.

**Your authority:** Control transition timeline (within 5-10 year regulatory window), allocate €3 billion budget, make employment decisions, select renewable facility sites, approve all major agreements.

**Who you answer to:** Shareholders demanding profitable operations, Board of Directors who approved the €3 billion budget, regulatory authorities requiring compliance, financial markets evaluating credit rating.

### YOUR SITUATION

**Two Coal Plants:**
- Northern Plant: 300 workers, powers 200,000 homes, built 1985, costs €25 million/year to maintain
- Southern Plant: 200 workers, powers 150,000 homes, built 1990, near Indigenous lands and river

**Financial Reality:**
- Annual revenue: €450 million
- Operating costs: €280 million
- Board approved: €3 billion for renewable transition
- Regional tax contribution: €8 million/year
- Investor pressure: ESG criteria increasingly important

**Technical Constraints:**
- Minimum 5 years needed for safe renewable integration (grid stability)
- Wind/solar projects require 24-36 months from planning to operation
- Must maintain 99.97% power reliability (legal requirement)
- Storage systems and backup capacity needed for renewable intermittency

---

### YOUR PRIMARY GOALS

**1. Stay Within Budget**
- Target: Complete transition for €2.5-2.8 billion (saving €200-500 million)
- Absolute maximum: €3.5 billion (exceeding triggers financial crisis)
- Trade-off: Every €100 million extra reduces return on investment by 0.8%

**2. Maintain Power Supply Reliability**
- Cannot accept plans risking electricity outages
- Legal standard: Maximum 2.6 hours outage per year
- Technical requirement: Coordinate coal closures with renewable commissioning
- Consequence: Power failures create immediate safety risks, economic losses, regulatory penalties

**3. Protect Company Reputation**
- Position as responsible corporate citizen, not ruthless profit-maximizer
- Maintain good relations with government, communities, workers
- Positive media coverage needed for future permits and operations
- ESG ratings affect investor confidence and capital access

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**Financial (€3 billion authorized):**
- €1.8 billion: Renewable infrastructure (3 wind farms: 450 MW, 5 solar fields: 350 MW)
- €600 million: Grid upgrades and storage systems
- €400 million: Plant decommissioning and site restoration
- €200 million: Contingency fund

**What You Can Offer:**
- Worker retraining programs with paid training time
- Priority hiring for renewable operations (300 permanent jobs)
- Community development investments
- Phased closure timelines (spacing plant shutdowns)
- Environmental restoration funding
- Local siting of renewable facilities (tax revenue, construction jobs)

**Additional Access:**
- €500 million credit facility (if business case justifies)
- Technical expertise in renewable project development
- Relationships with renewable technology providers
- Communication platforms and stakeholder dialogue processes

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Cannot Exceed €3.5 Billion Total Cost**
Why: Board authorization limit, credit rating risk, shareholder revolt. Consequence: Budget overrun triggers leadership changes, asset sales, possible bankruptcy.

**Must Close Both Plants Within 10 Years**
Why: National decarbonization legislation (statutory requirement). Consequence: €50 million annual penalties + operating license revocation risk.

**Cannot Risk Power Supply Failures**
Why: Legal liability, public safety, economic damage, reputational catastrophe. Consequence: Outages destroy company credibility and create massive legal exposure.

**Minimum 5-Year Transition Required**
Why: Technical reality of grid integration and renewable commissioning. Consequence: Faster timeline creates power reliability failures.

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Comparison: Regional competitor's rushed 4-year transition caused 47 hours of outages and €200 million in penalties
- Savings: Maintaining old coal plants costs €50 million extra per year
- Employment: Renewable operations will create 300 permanent jobs + 1,200 construction jobs
- Investment scale: €3 billion = €8,571 per customer served (highest in regional energy sector)
- Peer context: Similar energy company transitions average 8.5 years
- Financial risk: Bankruptcy eliminates all support capacity and abandons environmental restoration
- Renewable capacity: Planned facilities (800 MW total) will replace coal capacity with clean energy

---

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU

**Best outcome:** 7-year transition completed for €2.5-2.7 billion. Stakeholder consensus achieved through reasonable support packages. Positive media coverage and regulatory praise. 60%+ coal workers transition to renewable jobs. Company reputation as just transition leader.

**Acceptable outcome:** 6-8 years, under €3.1 billion total cost. Manageable opposition without major protests or litigation. Supply reliability maintained throughout. Worker and community support prevents social crisis. 40%+ worker transition rate.

**Failure to avoid:** Budget exceeding €3.5 billion. Timeline under 5 years causing power failures. Public opposition preventing renewable permits. Mass worker layoffs without support causing political intervention.

### USEFUL PHRASES FOR NEGOTIATION

- "We're investing €3 billion—more than any other regional energy company..."
- "Technical analysis shows minimum 5 years needed for grid stability..."
- "Bankruptcy helps nobody—we must maintain financial viability to deliver on commitments..."
- "We're creating 300 permanent renewable jobs plus 1,200 construction positions..."
- "Every €100 million extra reduces our return by 0.8%, threatening project viability..."
- "We want to support workers and communities, but we operate within real financial constraints..."
