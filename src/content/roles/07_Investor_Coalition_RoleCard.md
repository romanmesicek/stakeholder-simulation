# Investor Coalition
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent institutional investors collectively holding 68% of PowerShift Energy's equity—pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds. Your delegation includes representatives from the largest pension fund (22% stake), an ESG-focused asset manager (15%), an insurance company (12%), and a sovereign wealth fund (10%).

**Your authority:** 68% voting majority for corporate decisions, 3 of 9 board directors, capital provision required for transition (€750 million equity needed), capacity for engagement, voting action, or divestment.

**Who you represent:** Millions of beneficiaries—pensioners depending on returns for retirement, insurance policyholders, citizens of sovereign fund nations—whose financial security requires prudent investment management.

### YOUR SITUATION

**Financial Position:**
- Market capitalization: €4.2 billion
- Share price declined 18% since transition announcement
- Dividend yield: 4.8% (€200 million annual distribution)
- Credit rating: BBB+ (investment grade, but agencies monitoring transition)
- Coal plant book value: €1.2 billion (stranded asset risk €400-800 million)
- Transition requires €3 billion investment over 5-10 years

**Coalition Composition:**
- Pension Fund Alpha (22%): 2.1 million pensioners, 30+ year horizon, strong ESG policy
- Greenfield Asset Management (15%): ESG specialist, will divest if climate criteria unmet within 24 months
- Continental Insurance (12%): Climate risk exposure concerns
- Sovereign Wealth Fund (10%): Intergenerational mandate, reputation sensitive

**ESG Context:**
- Current ESG rating: BB (below investment grade equivalent)
- 78% of coalition capital has net-zero portfolio commitments
- Mandatory climate disclosure requirements tightening

---

### YOUR PRIMARY GOALS

**1. Protect and Enhance Long-Term Shareholder Value**
- Return on invested capital (ROIC) for renewables must exceed 8% hurdle rate
- Net present value positive transition at realistic discount rates (9-11%)
- Maintain investment grade credit rating throughout transition
- Preserve dividend capacity (minimum €150 million annually)
- Total shareholder return competitive with sector (minimum 6% annualized)

**2. Achieve Strong ESG Performance and Climate Alignment**
- ESG rating upgrade to BBB equivalent within 24 months
- Science-based emissions target: 50% reduction by 2030, net-zero by 2050
- Credible transition plan meeting disclosure requirements (TCFD)
- Third-party verification of emissions progress

**3. Ensure Execution Quality and Governance Accountability**
- Realistic timeline with technical feasibility verification
- Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Executive compensation linked to transition milestones (minimum 25%)
- Board oversight committee for transition
- Quarterly progress reporting to investors

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What You Control:**
- Voting power: 68% majority—can elect directors, approve transactions, pass resolutions
- Capital provision: Company needs €750 million equity; investors can approve, condition, or reject
- Board representation: 3 coalition-aligned directors
- Divestment option: Exit would depress share price 15-25%, raise capital costs

**What You Can Offer:**
- Capital approval for transition investment
- Patient timeline for execution (within reason)
- Positive market signaling supporting valuation
- Governance support for management during transition

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Fiduciary Duty Primacy**
Cannot support transition destroying shareholder value without commensurate long-term benefit.

**Minimum Return Thresholds**
Renewable investments must meet 8% hurdle rate. Returns below threshold destroy value.

**Credit Quality Maintenance**
Investment grade rating essential. Downgrade triggers €400 million bond covenant issues.

**Governance and Accountability**
Will not support plans lacking oversight, milestone accountability, and executive incentive alignment.

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- "We represent 4 million beneficiaries—pensioners whose retirement depends on returns. Fiduciary duty requires prioritizing their financial interests."
- "Transition must create value. Capital destroyed here is unavailable for other climate solutions."
- "Climate risk is financial risk. ESG integration is risk management, not charity."
- "Renewable investments must exceed our 8% hurdle. Below-threshold investments destroy value."
- "Major projects average 25% cost overruns. Without governance—milestones, reporting, compensation linkage—overruns are predictable."
- "Capital is mobile. Returns below threshold trigger reallocation."

---

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Best outcome:** 7-year timeline with projected ROIC 10%+. Total cost €2.8 billion. ESG rating upgraded to BBB within 18 months. Dividend maintained at €175 million. Executive compensation 40% linked to transition milestones. Credit rating maintained BBB+.

**Acceptable outcome:** 6-8 year timeline with ROIC 8.5%+. Total cost €3.1 billion. ESG improving to BBB- within 24 months. Dividend reduced to €150 million during peak years. 25%+ compensation linkage. Credit rating investment grade.

**Failure to avoid:** Projected ROIC below 7%. Unlimited or uncapped stakeholder commitments. Credit rating below investment grade. No governance mechanisms. Transition designed for non-financial objectives at shareholder expense.

### USEFUL PHRASES FOR NEGOTIATION

- "Fiduciary duty requires that transition create value, not destroy it. We're offering capital and patience for a transition that works..."
- "Climate risk is financial risk. We need this transition. But we need it executed well..."
- "Returns below our hurdle rate destroy value. Meeting 8% isn't exceptional—it's the minimum bar for competent execution..."
- "We support adequate stakeholder packages. Social license issues affect execution risk. This is risk mitigation, not charity..."
- "Our beneficiaries deserve both successful decarbonization and protected retirement security. Let's build a transition that achieves both."
