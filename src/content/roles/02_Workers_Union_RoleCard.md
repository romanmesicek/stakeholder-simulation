# Coal Plant Workers Union
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent 500 coal plant workers—technicians, operators, maintenance staff, engineers—and the approximately 2,000 family members who depend on these jobs. Your delegation includes union officials, shop stewards, and elected worker representatives.

**Your authority:** Collective bargaining rights (98% union membership), operational knowledge essential for safe plant operations, potential for industrial action (3-month strike fund available), voice of workers in all transition decisions, veto power through membership votes (75% required for major changes).

**Who you represent:** 500 direct workers at both plants, 2,000 total family members, community members whose livelihoods depend on plant wages, future generations seeking sustainable employment.

### YOUR PRIMARY GOALS

**1. No Forced Unemployment Without Real Alternatives**
- Target: 70% of workforce transitioned to new employment
- Every worker needs either: guaranteed renewable job, fully-funded retraining, OR fair voluntary exit package
- Retraining must be paid (90% wage during 12-18 month programs)
- Priority hiring for renewable operations with comparable wages

**2. Protect Pension Rights**
- Full pension entitlements regardless of employment changes
- No penalties for shortened service or job changes
- Bridge payments for early retirement (ages 55-65)
- Company funding for pension gaps from workforce reductions

**3. Preserve Community Viability**
- Prevent mass unemployment that destroys Northern Town economy
- Minimum 3 years between plant closures (allows gradual adjustment)
- Local content: 60% of renewable construction jobs for local workers
- Renewable facilities sited near existing communities (commuting distance)

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What You Control:**
- Operational knowledge: Only current workers know how to safely run and shut down these specific plants
- Public sympathy: Strong public support for workers facing job loss
- Industrial action: Legal right to strike (would halt power for 350,000 homes)
- Political connections: Local politicians need your votes
- Technical expertise: Skills transferable to renewable operations (electrical: 85%, mechanical: 80%, grid: 90%, safety: 95%)

**What You Can Offer:**
- Cooperation with phased plant closure
- Knowledge transfer for safe decommissioning
- No strikes or work disruptions
- Workforce for renewable operations
- Public support for company's transition
- Younger workers already training in renewable energy

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**No Forced Redundancies Without Fair Packages**
Union rules prohibit accepting involuntary unemployment without: equivalent jobs, funded retraining with income protection, OR voluntary packages exceeding legal minimums. Minimum acceptable: 1.5 months pay per year of service + €15,000 transition bonus.

**Full Pension Protection**
Cannot accept any reduction in pension entitlements. Pension is deferred compensation already earned. Membership vote required for any change (75% threshold).

**Minimum 5-6 Year Timeline**
Need minimum 2 years notice before first plant closure. Minimum 3 years between plant closures. Inadequate time prevents effective retraining and family planning.

**Quality Retraining Standards**
Programs must be accredited with recognized qualifications. Reasonable duration: 12-18 months. Demonstrated employment outcomes. Independent oversight.

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Family impact: 500 jobs support 2,000 family members; with economic multipliers, 1,200-1,500 total jobs at risk
- Mortgage crisis: Average worker has €120,000 mortgage on €45,000 income—unemployment means immediate default risk for 200+ families
- Skills value: Coal workers have critical transferable skills needed for renewable sector
- Health sacrifice: Many workers show coal-related health conditions from decades keeping regional lights on
- Community collapse: Northern Town property values already dropped 15%; rapid closure triggers full economic collapse affecting 15,000 residents
- Just transition principle: International Labor Organization guidelines require social dialogue, adequate time, income protection, retraining
- Company profits: PowerShift earned €170 million annually over 40 years = €6.8 billion total profit from coal operations

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE FOR YOU

**Best outcome:** 7-8 year transition timeline. €250-300 million dedicated worker support fund. Comprehensive retraining covering 90% workforce with full income protection. Priority hiring achieving 70% renewable job placement. Early retirement options with pension bridges for workers 55+. Voluntary redundancy: 2 months per service year + €20,000 support. Zero involuntary layoffs. Community support fund ensuring alternative employment emerges.

**Acceptable outcome:** 6-7 year timeline. €200 million worker support. Retraining covering 75% workforce with 85% income protection. 50%+ renewable job placement. Voluntary redundancy: 1.5 months per service year + €15,000. Involuntary layoffs limited to 10% with enhanced packages. Pension protection maintained.

**Failure to avoid:** Timeline under 5 years forcing rushed displacement. Worker support under €100 million. Inadequate retraining leaving workers unemployable. Forced layoffs exceeding 30% without fair packages. Any pension reductions. Community abandonment creating ghost town.

### USEFUL PHRASES FOR NEGOTIATION

- "500 workers support 2,000 family members—these aren't just jobs, they're livelihoods..."
- "We have the skills you need for renewable operations—invest in retraining, not replacement..."
- "Workers sacrificed their health for 40 years keeping regional lights on—society owes them basic fairness..."
- "Rushed transitions destroy families: mortgage defaults, forced relocation, children's education disrupted..."
- "We're not against renewable energy—many younger members are already training in clean tech..."
- "Adequate support makes rapid transition possible and fair—inadequate support makes it impossible and unjust..."
- "Ghost towns help nobody—community collapse creates lasting opposition to climate action..."
