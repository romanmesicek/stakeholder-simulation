# Structured Debriefing Guide

This guide supports the facilitator in leading a structured debriefing session following the simulation. The questions are organized according to the 4-phase debriefing model used in experiential learning contexts.

---

## Phase 1: Defusing (5 minutes)

*Purpose: Allow participants to process emotions and transition out of their roles.*

**Opening Questions:**
- How are you feeling right now?
- What was your initial reaction when you received your role?
- What was the most frustrating moment during the simulation?
- What was the most satisfying moment?

**Facilitator Note:** This phase is about emotional decompression. Let participants vent and share reactions without judgment. Validate frustrations as part of the learning experience.

## Phase 2: Discovery (10 minutes)

*Purpose: Surface observations and shared experiences before analysis.*

### Coalition Dynamics
- What alliances did you observe forming? What enabled them?
- Were there any surprising partnerships that emerged?
- What caused coalitions to break down or shift?
- Which stakeholder groups ended up isolated? Why?

### Power and Influence
- Where did power asymmetries become most visible?
- Which stakeholders had more influence than their formal position suggested? Why?
- How did information asymmetry affect negotiations?
- Did any group's power increase or decrease during the simulation?

### Negotiation Dynamics
- What creative solutions emerged that you didn't anticipate?
- What blocked potential agreements?
- How did groups handle their non-negotiable constraints?
- Were there any "breakthrough moments" where positions shifted significantly?

## Phase 3: Deepening (5 minutes)

*Purpose: Connect observations to theoretical frameworks and course concepts.*

### Wicked Problems
- How did this simulation illustrate "wicked problem" characteristics?
- What made finding a solution so difficult?
- Could any single stakeholder have solved this alone? Why not?

### Just Transition Framework
- Which justice dimensions were most contested?
  - **Distributional**: Who bears the costs? Who gets the benefits?
  - **Procedural**: Was the decision-making process fair?
  - **Recognition**: Were all stakeholders' identities and needs acknowledged?

### Stakeholder Salience
- How did stakeholders' salience (power, legitimacy, urgency) shift during negotiations?
- Which attribute was most important for influencing outcomes?
- Did any stakeholder gain or lose legitimacy during the process?

### Transition Management
- What role did timeline and sequencing play in negotiations?
- How did technical constraints shape the solution space?
- What institutional arrangements emerged to manage the transition?

---

## Phase 4: Transfer (Facilitator-Led Discussion)

*Purpose: Apply learnings to real-world contexts and personal development.*

### Real-World Application
- How might real-world energy transitions differ from this simulation?
- What factors did the simulation oversimplify or omit?
- Can you think of a real transition case where similar dynamics played out?

### Personal Learning
- What negotiation strategies would you apply differently?
- What surprised you about your own behavior in the role?
- How did playing a role with interests different from your personal views affect your perspective?

### Professional Relevance
- How might you apply these stakeholder management insights in your future career?
- What skills from this simulation are transferable to other contexts?

## Facilitator Notes

### Timing Guidance
- Defusing: 5 min (don't rush this phase)
- Discovery: 10 min (most substantive phase)
- Deepening: 5 min (connect to theory)
- Transfer is embedded in the reflection assignment

### Common Debriefing Pitfalls to Avoid
- Skipping the defusing phase
- Allowing one voice to dominate
- Moving to analysis before participants have shared experiences
- Providing "correct answers" instead of facilitating discovery

### Signs of Effective Debriefing
- Participants reference specific moments from the simulation
- "Aha" moments about power dynamics or coalition formation
- Connections made between simulation and course readings
- Participants showing curiosity about other groups' experiences
