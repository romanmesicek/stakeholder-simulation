# An Energy Transition Case

## A Multi-Stakeholder Governance Dilemma in a Socio-Technical System Transformation

---

## Case Overview

PowerShift Energy Corporation faces a paradigmatic socio-technical transition requiring simultaneous management of technological substitution, institutional reconfiguration, and distributive justice imperatives. The corporation operates two coal-fired power plants—Northern Plant (300 MW, 300 employees) and Southern Plant (200 MW, 200 employees)—serving 350,000 households while supporting approximately 1,000 indirect regional employment positions.

This case exemplifies the "wicked problem" characteristics inherent in sustainability transitions: irreducible complexity, value pluralism, deep uncertainty, and contested knowledge claims (Rittel & Webber, 1973). No single stakeholder possesses sufficient resources or authority for unilateral implementation. Success requires coalition formation, creative value creation expanding negotiation space, and acceptance of imperfect but workable compromises.

## The Transition Imperative

The transition imperative emerges from multiple systemic pressures operating across temporal and spatial scales:

- **Regulatory frameworks** mandate compliance with European Green Deal objectives requiring 55% emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 (European Commission, 2021).

- **Financial markets** increasingly price climate risk through elevated capital costs for fossil assets and stranded asset devaluations (Caldecott et al., 2016).

- **Technological disruption** renders coal generation economically obsolete relative to renewable alternatives achieving grid parity. Current levelized cost estimates place solar PV at €30–45/MWh and onshore wind at €25–40/MWh versus coal at €65–150/MWh including environmental externalities (Lazard, 2024).

- **Social movements** mobilize legitimacy crises challenging fossil fuel infrastructure's social license to operate (Mayer & Gereffi, 2010).

International Energy Agency projections indicate coal-fired power generation must decline 80% by 2030 relative to 2010 levels to maintain Paris Agreement trajectory (IEA, 2023).

## Technical Parameters and Constraints

Energy system transitions face irreducible technical constraints that establish minimum feasibility boundaries (Hughes, 1983). The Technical Expert Panel assessment identifies the following parameters:

### Grid Integration Requirements

- Regional grid peak demand: 2,400 MW
- PowerShift contribution: 800 MW (33% of regional generation)
- Grid stability requires N-1 contingency and minimum 18% reserve margin
- Coal plants provide grid inertia; renewable replacement requires synchronous condensers or grid-forming batteries

### Development Timeline Realities

| Infrastructure | Development Cycle |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Wind farm | 24–30 months |
| Solar installation | 18–24 months |
| Battery storage | 18–24 months |
| Major grid upgrades | 24–36 months |

With eight major facilities requiring coordinated commissioning, realistic implementation spans 6–7 years minimum. Attempts to compress timelines below 5 years create unacceptable reliability risks for 350,000 households.

### Investment Requirements

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|----------|----------------|
| Renewable infrastructure | €1.8 billion |
| Grid upgrades and storage | €600 million |
| Storage systems (200 MW/800 MWh) | €320 million |
| Plant decommissioning | €400 million |
| Contingency (industry standard 15–25%) | €200 million |

Major infrastructure projects average 25% cost overruns and 30% schedule delays. Contingency allocation represents engineering necessity, not pessimism (Flyvbjerg, 2014).

## Stakeholder Landscape

The transition affects diverse constituencies with legitimate but competing interests. Geels' (2002) multi-level perspective illuminates interactions between technological niches (renewable energy), socio-technical regimes (coal-based electricity), and landscape pressures (climate policy, financial markets).

Eight stakeholder groups hold significant stakes in the transition outcome:

| Stakeholder Group | Primary Domain |
|-------------------|----------------|
| PowerShift Energy Management | Corporate decision-making and capital allocation |
| Coal Plant Workers Union | Employment security and workforce transition |
| Local Community Coalition | Regional economic vitality and public services |
| Environmental Alliance | Climate action and ecosystem protection |
| Regional Government | Policy implementation and public interest |
| Indigenous Community | Rights recognition and environmental justice |
| Investor Coalition | Financial returns and ESG performance |
| Technical Expert Panel | Feasibility assessment and risk analysis |

### Stakeholder Complexity

The transition creates fundamental tensions among stakeholder interests:

**Employment and economic concerns** affect workers who possess specialized technical competencies developed over decades, and host communities that depend on plant-generated tax revenue funding essential public services. Regional economic multipliers indicate each direct job supports 2.5 indirect positions.

**Environmental imperatives** reflect climate urgency given atmospheric CO₂ exceeding 420 ppm and narrowing carbon budgets. Local air pollution from coal combustion causes documented public health impacts, with PM2.5 exposure linked to significant premature mortality across Europe (European Environment Agency, 2022). Ecosystem degradation from thermal discharge and heavy metal contamination requires comprehensive remediation.

**Governance responsibilities** require balancing multiple objectives: energy security (maintaining 99.97% supply reliability), climate commitments (legally binding emission reduction targets), social stability (preventing unemployment-triggered unrest), and fiscal constraints (competing public investment priorities).

**Community development needs** include economic diversification preventing single-employer dependency, infrastructure investment enabling alternative development pathways, and youth opportunity creation reversing demographic decline.

**Rights-based claims** assert cultural preservation and environmental justice regarding disproportionate pollution burdens, drawing on international human rights frameworks including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (United Nations, 2007).

**Financial requirements** from majority equity holders demand returns meeting fiduciary obligations while increasingly integrating ESG criteria into investment decisions. Climate risk is financial risk (Carney, 2015).

**Technical realities** establish feasibility boundaries within which all negotiations must occur. Engineering constraints are not obstacles to overcome but parameters defining the solution space.

## Theoretical Foundations

This simulation operationalizes multiple theoretical frameworks examining sustainability transitions:

### Multi-Level Perspective

Geels (2002) conceptualizes socio-technical transitions as interactions between three analytical levels: niches (protected spaces where innovations develop), regimes (dominant practices and rules), and landscape (macro-level trends). Coal-to-renewable transition exemplifies regime destabilization through niche breakthrough enabled by landscape pressure.

### Transition Management

Rotmans et al. (2001) propose governance mechanisms balancing strategic vision with operational flexibility. Transition arenas enable stakeholder deliberation; transition experiments test innovations; and transition monitoring tracks system dynamics. The approach emphasizes adaptive governance under uncertainty.

### Just Transition Frameworks

McCauley and Heffron (2018) identify three justice dimensions in energy transitions:

- **Distributional justice**: Fair allocation of costs and benefits
- **Procedural justice**: Inclusive decision-making processes
- **Recognition justice**: Acknowledging affected communities' identities and needs

The International Labour Organization's Just Transition Guidelines (ILO, 2015) operationalize these principles through social dialogue requirements, adequate support provisions, and affected community participation.

### Stakeholder Salience

Mitchell et al. (1997) theorize stakeholder salience as a function of three attributes: power (ability to impose will), legitimacy (socially accepted claims), and urgency (time-sensitivity of claims). Stakeholders possessing all three attributes demand immediate managerial attention. The dynamic nature of salience—attributes gained and lost through negotiation—creates strategic complexity.

## Critical Decision Parameters

The case embodies fundamental governance tensions requiring explicit navigation:

### Temporal Dynamics

Climate physics demands rapid decarbonization while social systems require adjustment time. Each year of delay adds 4 million tons CO₂ emissions, yet rushed transitions risk community collapse and political backlash. Balancing urgency against adaptation capacity represents a core challenge.

### Distributional Choices

Who bears economic burden: shareholders, workers, taxpayers, communities? How are renewable energy opportunities distributed? What constitutes fair compensation for stranded assets and disrupted livelihoods? The €3.5 billion total available resources (company + government) cannot satisfy all legitimate claims simultaneously.

### Technical-Social Interface

Grid stability requires careful renewable integration while stakeholders demand decisive action. Engineering constraints intersect social patience limits. The Technical Expert Panel establishes feasibility boundaries within which negotiation must occur.

### Governance Legitimacy

How should transition decisions incorporate diverse stakeholder voices? What governance structures balance expertise with representation? Technocratic efficiency may conflict with democratic participation, yet excluding affected parties undermines implementation legitimacy (Fung & Wright, 2003).

## Simulation Objectives

This exercise challenges participants to:

1. Navigate multi-stakeholder negotiation dynamics under structural power asymmetries
2. Apply sustainability transition governance mechanisms and institutional arrangements
3. Operationalize distributive justice principles in decarbonization contexts
4. Develop socio-technical system transformation management strategies
5. Construct polycentric governance arrangements acknowledging power asymmetries while enabling collective action

The simulation illuminates how sustainability transitions necessitate institutional innovation beyond market mechanisms or hierarchical control, demanding new forms of collaborative governance navigating legitimacy, efficacy, and justice simultaneously (Ostrom, 2010).
