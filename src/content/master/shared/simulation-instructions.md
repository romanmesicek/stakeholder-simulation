## Phase 0: Opening & Role Distribution (5 min)

- Draw a role slip randomly
- Join your stakeholder group table
- Collect your materials packet

---

## Phase 1: Reading & Strategy (40 min)

1. **Read** the case document and your role card carefully (15 min)
2. **Understand** your goals, resources, and constraints
3. **Analyze** the stakeholder landscape — Who holds power? Who shares your interests?
4. **Strategize** with your group — Who do you need? What can you offer? What are your red lines?
5. **Prepare** a 1-minute opening statement emphasizing your legitimate claims

Your role card is confidential. Do not share your specific constraints or bottom lines.

---

## Phase 2: Pitches & Voting (20 min)

**Opening Statements (10 min)** — Each group presents 1 minute, in order:

1. PowerShift Energy Management
2. Coal Plant Workers Union
3. Local Community Coalition
4. Environmental Alliance
5. Regional Government
6. Indigenous Community
7. Investor Coalition
8. Technical Expert Panel

**Stakeholder Mapping (10 min)** — Via Mentimeter:
- Rate each stakeholder on Interest (1–10) and Power (1–10)
- Predict the outcome: Win-win / Partial / Zero-sum / Deadlock
- Identify your most likely coalition partners

## Phase 3: Negotiations (75 min)

| Round | Duration | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | 12 min | Assigned bilateral — meet your designated partner |
| 2 | 12 min | Assigned bilateral — meet your second designated partner |
| 3 | 10 min | Open bilateral — choose one group you haven't met |
| 4 | 20 min | Coalition building — form groups of 3–4, draft joint positions |
| 5 | 21 min | Coalition refinement — finalize agreements, address remaining conflicts |

**Round 1 Pairings:** Management + Workers | Community + Government | Environmental + Indigenous | Investors + Technical

**Round 2 Pairings:** Management + Investors | Workers + Community | Environmental + Technical | Indigenous + Government

**Round 3:** Choose strategically — meet a group that could strengthen or threaten your coalition.

**Rounds 4–5:** Coalition building phase. Form alliances, negotiate trade-offs, and prepare joint position statements.

**Remember:** No agreement is a real outcome. Your constraints are real. Coalitions shift. Document all agreements in writing.

---

## Phase 4: Final Positions & Results (25 min)

- Each group gives a 2-minute final statement including:
  - Key agreements reached
  - Remaining concerns or unresolved issues
  - Coalition partnerships formed
- Outcome summary (timeline, budget, agreements, unresolved issues)
- Mentimeter results revealed — compare predictions vs. reality
- Discussion: What enabled or blocked consensus?

---

## Phase 5: Structured Debrief (20 min)

**Defusing (5 min):** Step out of role. Share initial reactions.

**Discovery (10 min):**
- What coalitions formed? What blocked others?
- Where did power asymmetries become most visible?
- What creative solutions emerged?

**Deepening (5 min):**
- How did this simulation illustrate "wicked problem" characteristics?
- Which justice dimensions (distributional, procedural, recognition) were most contested?

**Reflection Assignment — Due: [Date TBD]**

1000–1200 words addressing:
1. **Experience** — Most significant moment? What surprised you?
2. **Analysis** — How did stakeholder salience (power, legitimacy, urgency) shift during negotiations?
3. **Coalitions** — What enabled successful alliances? What caused breakdowns?
4. **Theory** — Connect your observations to course concepts (transition management, just transition, stakeholder theory)
5. **Transfer** — What would you do differently? How does this apply to real-world transitions?
