# Investor Coalition
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent institutional investors (pension funds, asset managers) who collectively own 68% of PowerShift Energy. You manage money for millions of pensioners and savers who depend on returns for their retirement.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Your Investment:**
- 68% voting majority (you control the company)
- Company value: €4.2 billion
- Share price dropped 18% since transition news
- Coal plants represent €400-800 million stranded asset risk

**Investor Priorities:**
- Pension funds: need stable returns for retirees
- ESG investors: will divest if climate performance poor
- All: need transition that creates value, not destroys it

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Protect shareholder value** — Returns must exceed 8% hurdle rate
2. **Strong ESG performance** — Upgrade ESG rating within 24 months
3. **Governance accountability** — Milestones, reporting, executive incentives

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- 68% voting majority (can elect directors, approve investments)
- Capital provision (company needs €750 million equity)
- Divestment option (exit would crash share price)

**What you can offer:**
- Capital approval for transition
- Patient timeline (within reason)
- Governance support for management
- Positive market signaling

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Fiduciary duty** — Must prioritize beneficiaries' financial interests
- **Minimum 8% return** — Below this destroys value
- **Maintain credit rating** — Downgrade triggers €400 million bond issues
- **Governance mechanisms** — Milestones, accountability, reporting

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- We represent 4 million beneficiaries—pensioners depending on returns
- Climate risk is financial risk—ESG is risk management
- Major projects average 25% cost overruns without proper governance
- Capital destroyed here is unavailable for other climate solutions

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** 7-year timeline. 10%+ returns. ESG rating upgraded. Dividends maintained.

**Acceptable:** 6-8 years. 8.5%+ returns. Improving ESG. Credit rating maintained.

**Avoid:** Returns below 7%. Unlimited costs. No accountability. Credit downgrade.

---

### USEFUL PHRASES

- "Fiduciary duty requires that transition create value, not destroy it..."
- "Climate risk is financial risk—we need this transition done well..."
- "We support adequate stakeholder packages—social license reduces risk..."
- "Returns below 8% are unacceptable—that's the minimum, not exceptional..."
