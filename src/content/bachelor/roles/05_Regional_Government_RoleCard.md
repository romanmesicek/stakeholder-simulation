# Regional Government
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent regional government authorities responsible for balancing economic development, social welfare, environmental protection, and energy security. You must keep everyone reasonably satisfied while meeting legal obligations.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Political Reality:**
- Election in 24 months—transition handling determines outcome
- Northern Town + Southern Region = 23,000 voters (swing constituencies)
- Coalition government with internal tensions
- Media scrutiny is intense

**Legal Obligations:**
- Climate law: 45% emissions reduction by 2030
- Energy security: 99.97% availability required
- Social protection: Prevent mass unemployment

**Budget:**
- €500 million transition fund available
- Emergency reserve: €150 million (if crisis)
- Maximum total: €650 million

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Energy security** — No blackouts for 350,000 homes
2. **Prevent social crisis** — Avoid mass unemployment
3. **Meet climate targets** — 45% reduction by 2030

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- €500-650 million public funding
- Permit approval/denial authority
- Retraining programs through technical colleges
- Economic development support
- Political leverage and media access

**What you can offer:**
- Public funding contribution
- Fast-track permits (saves €30-50 million)
- Employment services
- Infrastructure investment
- "Honest broker" role in negotiations

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Energy security** — Cannot risk blackouts
- **Climate compliance** — €50 million annual penalties if targets missed
- **Budget limit** — Cannot exceed €650 million
- **Social stability** — Cannot accept visible social crisis

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Rushed 4-year transitions elsewhere caused 47-hour outages
- €500 million = 18% of annual budget (significant commitment)
- €50 million annual penalties for missing climate targets
- 23,000 voters in affected communities

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** 6-year transition. Energy security maintained. Climate targets met. Re-election.

**Acceptable:** 5-7 years. €500 million public investment. Manageable opposition.

**Avoid:** Blackouts. Social crisis. Over €650 million cost. Electoral catastrophe.
