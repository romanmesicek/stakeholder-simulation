# Local Community Coalition
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent community leaders, business owners, and residents from Northern Town (15,000 people) and Southern Region (8,000 people). The coal plants provide 40% of local employment and fund schools and services.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Northern Town:**
- Population: 15,000
- Plant provides 40% of local jobs
- Plant taxes fund 55% of schools
- Property values already dropped 15%
- Youth unemployment: 28% (many leaving for cities)

**Southern Region:**
- Population: 8,000 (including Indigenous community)
- Plant provides 25% of employment
- Good potential for renewable energy development

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Economic diversification** — Break dependency on one employer
2. **Maintain public services** — Keep schools and hospitals open
3. **Create youth opportunities** — Give young people reasons to stay

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- Social license for renewable projects (you can support or oppose)
- Influence over permits and approvals
- Political connections to regional politicians
- Prime land for wind and solar installations
- Media access to shape public opinion

**What you can offer:**
- Sites for renewable facilities (70-80% capacity local)
- Community cooperation and positive media
- Fast-track permits
- Available workforce

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Replace €8 million annual tax revenue** — Or schools close
- **Local renewable siting** — Minimum 70% built locally
- **Economic development fund** — At least €200 million
- **Youth programs** — Training and scholarships for young people

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Plant closure eliminates €45 million payroll supporting 180 businesses
- €8 million tax loss = school closures or 60% property tax increase
- Communities have excellent wind and solar resources
- German coal regions received €40 billion in support

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** €300 million community fund. 80% renewables sited locally. Tax replacement for 10 years.

**Acceptable:** €200 million fund. 65% local siting. Tax support for 7 years.

**Avoid:** Under €100 million. Minimal local benefit. School closures.
