## Stakeholder Role Card

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent 500 coal plant workers and their 2,000 family members. Your members have worked here for decades and have no other local employment options. Many have mortgages and families depending on these jobs.

**Worker Profile:**
- 500 workers across both plants
- Average tenure: 18 years
- Average age: 45 years
- Most have only coal plant experience

**Financial Reality:**
- Monthly income: €2,500-4,500
- Average mortgage: €120,000
- Limited savings (about 6 months expenses)

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **No forced unemployment** — Every worker needs a real alternative
2. **Protect pensions** — Workers earned these over decades
3. **Preserve community** — Prevent economic collapse in Northern Town

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- Operational knowledge essential for safe plant operations

**What you can offer:**
- Cooperation with phased closure

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Quality retraining** — Real programs with recognized qualifications

### SUCCESS FOR YOU
