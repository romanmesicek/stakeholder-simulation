# Indigenous Community
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent 3,000 Indigenous community members whose traditional lands surround the Southern Plant. Your community has lived on this land for thousands of years.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Historical Harm:**
- Southern Plant built 35 years ago with minimal consultation
- River polluted: mercury 300% above safe limits
- Traditional fishing no longer safe
- Respiratory illness 23% above regional average

**Your Community:**
- 90 members work at Southern Plant (18% of workforce)
- Unemployment: 35% (vs 8% regional)
- Exceptional wind/solar resources on your territory

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **River restoration** — Clean water within 7 years, €60 million budget
2. **Ownership stake** — Minimum 25% ownership in renewables, not just jobs
3. **Jobs for your people** — 100 guaranteed positions + training
4. **Respect your rights** — Consent required for development on your land

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- Legal rights: Constitutional protections, international frameworks
- Strategic land: Best renewable sites are on your territory
- Moral authority: Public supports Indigenous environmental justice

**What you can offer:**
- Land access for renewable development
- Smooth permitting through community support
- Workforce and traditional knowledge

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **River must be restored** — Cannot accept any deal without cleanup
- **Real ownership required** — Jobs alone are not enough
- **Sacred sites protected** — No facilities in cultural zones
- **Your consent matters** — No decisions imposed without consultation

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Mercury poisoned our fish—our traditional food source for millennia
- 90 of our members already work at Southern Plant—we have the skills
- Our territory has 95th percentile renewable resources
- We are not going anywhere—we will remain on this land

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** 30% ownership, €80 million river restoration, 120 jobs, €50 million community fund.

**Acceptable:** 25% ownership, €60 million restoration, 90 jobs, community benefit fund.

**Avoid:** Token ownership (<15%), inadequate cleanup, jobs without lasting wealth.

### USEFUL PHRASES

- "The river you call a 'cooling system' we call the life-giver..."
- "Development on our territory requires partnership or faces legal challenge..."
- "We're not asking for charity—we're offering partnership..."
- "Restoration. Ownership. Employment. Rights. These are our requirements."
