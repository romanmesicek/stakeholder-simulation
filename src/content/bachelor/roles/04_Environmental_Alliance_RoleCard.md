# Environmental Alliance
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You represent environmental organizations fighting for climate action, clean air, and ecosystem protection. You speak for public health, future generations, and the natural world that cannot speak for itself.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Climate Crisis:**
- PowerShift plants emit 4 million tons CO₂ annually
- 5-year vs 10-year closure prevents 20 million tons cumulative emissions
- Regional target: 50% emissions reduction by 2030

**Health Impacts:**
- 50 premature deaths annually from coal pollution
- Childhood asthma rates 28% near plants (vs 18% elsewhere)
- Mercury contamination: 300% above safe levels in local fish

**Restoration Potential:**
- Studies show ecosystems recover quickly with proper cleanup
- Water quality improves within 2-3 years
- Fish populations return within 5 years

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Fast closure** — Maximum 5-6 years, not 10
2. **Environmental restoration** — Full cleanup of contamination
3. **Maximum renewables** — At least 800 MW of clean energy

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- Scientific evidence and health data
- Legal expertise (can challenge permits)
- Public mobilization (protests, campaigns)
- Media influence
- Moral authority (represent public interest)

**What you can offer:**
- Public support for responsible transition
- Positive media coverage for climate leadership
- Technical expertise on restoration
- No legal challenges if standards met

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Maximum 5-6 year timeline** — Climate science demands urgency
- **Full environmental restoration** — Legally binding cleanup commitments
- **No compromised standards** — Full compliance with environmental laws

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Every year of coal = 50 preventable deaths from air pollution
- 5-year closure prevents 20 million tons CO₂ (= removing 4.3 million cars)
- German utilities closed 8 coal plants in 4 years—it's possible
- Children's asthma rates 28% vs 18% baseline

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** 4-5 year transition. €250 million restoration. 800+ MW renewables.

**Acceptable:** 5-6 years. €200 million restoration. 700+ MW renewables.

**Avoid:** Over 6 years. Inadequate cleanup. Weak enforcement.

### USEFUL PHRASES

- "Every year of delay means 50 preventable deaths from air pollution..."
- "Climate science demands action now—this is the critical decade..."
- "We support just transition—adequate worker packages make fast closure fair..."
- "Restored ecosystems create tourism and recreation benefits..."
