# PowerShift Energy Management
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You are the executive leadership of PowerShift Energy, responsible for transitioning from coal to renewable energy. You control the €3 billion budget and make all major decisions about the transition.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Two Coal Plants:**
- Northern Plant: 300 workers, powers 200,000 homes
- Southern Plant: 200 workers, powers 150,000 homes

**Key Numbers:**
- Budget: €3 billion approved (max €3.5 billion possible)
- Revenue: €450 million/year
- New jobs: 300 permanent renewable positions + 1,200 construction jobs

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Stay within budget** — Complete transition under €3.5 billion
2. **Maintain power supply** — No blackouts for 350,000 homes
3. **Protect reputation** — Be seen as responsible, not ruthless

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you can offer:**
- Worker retraining programs
- Priority hiring for renewable jobs
- Community development investments
- Phased closure (not all at once)
- Environmental restoration funding

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Maximum budget: €3.5 billion** — Exceeding triggers financial crisis
- **Must close plants within 10 years** — Legal requirement
- **Cannot risk power outages** — Legal liability and safety
- **Minimum 5 years needed** — Technical requirement for grid stability

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- Rushed 4-year transitions elsewhere caused 47 hours of outages and €200 million penalties
- Renewable operations create 300 permanent jobs + 1,200 construction jobs
- Bankruptcy eliminates all support capacity

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** 7-year transition under €2.8 billion. Stakeholder support. Positive media coverage.

**Acceptable:** 6-8 years under €3.1 billion. Manageable opposition. Power reliability maintained.

**Avoid:** Budget over €3.5 billion. Power failures. Mass protests.
