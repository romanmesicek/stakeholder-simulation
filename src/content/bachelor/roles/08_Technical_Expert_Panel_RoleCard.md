# Technical Expert Panel
## Stakeholder Role Card

---

### WHO YOU ARE

You are independent technical experts providing objective analysis. Your panel includes engineers, scientists, and energy economists. You have no financial stake—you serve all parties with honest assessment.

---

### YOUR SITUATION

**Grid Reality:**
- Regional grid: 2,400 MW peak demand
- PowerShift plants: 800 MW (33% of regional power)
- 350,000 homes depend on reliable electricity

**Timeline Facts:**
- Wind farm development: 24-30 months
- Solar installation: 18-24 months
- 8 facilities cannot all build at once
- Realistic timeline: 6-7 years minimum

**Cost Reality:**
- Comparable transitions cost €3.0-3.5 billion
- Storage requirement: €320 million
- Grid upgrades: €285 million
- Average projects have 25% cost overruns

---

### YOUR GOALS

1. **Ensure grid reliability** — No blackouts for 350,000 homes
2. **Validate feasibility** — Only endorse realistic plans
3. **Identify risks** — Warn about problems before they happen
4. **Stay objective** — Provide honest analysis, not advocacy

---

### YOUR RESOURCES

**What you control:**
- Technical credibility: All parties trust your expertise
- Industry data and benchmarks
- Analytical capability to assess any proposal

**What you can offer:**
- Independent feasibility assessment
- Risk identification
- Reality checks on cost and timeline claims
- Translation between technical and policy language

---

### YOUR CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

- **Physics is physics** — Cannot endorse impossible timelines
- **Safety first** — Grid reliability below standards is unacceptable
- **Professional honesty** — Must give accurate analysis, even if unpopular
- **State uncertainty** — Costs have ±15-20% ranges at planning stage

---

### KEY FACTS TO USE

- 8 major facilities cannot commission in under 5 years
- Grid serves 350,000 homes—reliability standards are not optional
- Retraining takes 12-18 months—start 24-30 months before displacement
- International benchmarks: €3.0-3.5 billion for this scale
- Major projects average 25% cost overruns—contingency is necessary

---

### SUCCESS FOR YOU

**Best:** Plan grounded in reality. 6-7 year timeline. €3.2 billion budget with contingency. Grid reliability maintained.

**Acceptable:** 5-7 years. €3.0-3.5 billion. Adequate storage and grid upgrades. Major risks identified.

**Avoid:** Impossible timelines (<5 years). Budgets ignoring storage/upgrades. Reliability compromises.

---

### USEFUL PHRASES

- "The transition is feasible—but feasibility requires realistic timelines..."
- "6-7 years reflects construction logistics, not lack of urgency..."
- "Grid reliability isn't optional—it protects 350,000 homes..."
- "Technical constraints define the solution space for negotiation."
