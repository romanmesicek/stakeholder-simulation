# Debriefing Guide

A quick guide for facilitating the post-simulation discussion.

## Phase 1: How Are You Feeling? (3 min)

Let participants decompress after their roles.

- How are you feeling right now?
- What was the most frustrating moment?
- What was the most satisfying moment?

---

## Phase 2: What Happened? (5 min)

Surface observations before analysis.

**Alliances & Conflicts:**
- What alliances formed? What enabled them?
- Which groups ended up isolated? Why?

**Power Dynamics:**
- Who had the most influence? Why?
- Did any group's power change during the simulation?

**Negotiations:**
- What creative solutions emerged?
- What blocked potential agreements?

---

## Phase 3: What Did You Learn? (5 min)

Connect to course concepts.

- What made finding a solution so difficult?
- Could any single stakeholder have solved this alone?
- Which stakeholders' needs were hardest to reconcile?
- How did technical constraints affect what was possible?

---

## Phase 4: Real-World Application (2 min)

- How might real energy transitions differ from this simulation?
- What surprised you about your own behavior in the role?

## Facilitator Tips

**Timing:** Keep it moving—15 minutes total.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Skipping the feelings phase
- Letting one voice dominate
- Providing "correct answers" instead of facilitating discussion

**Signs of Success:**
- Participants reference specific moments
- "Aha" moments about power dynamics
- Curiosity about other groups' experiences
