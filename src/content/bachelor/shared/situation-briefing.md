# An Energy Transition Case

## The Challenge

PowerShift Energy Corporation must close its two coal plants and switch to renewable energy. This affects many people with different interests—and no single group can solve the problem alone.

---

## The Company

PowerShift operates two coal-fired power plants:

| Plant | Workers | Homes Served | Built |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------|
| Northern Plant | 300 | 200,000 | 1985 |
| Southern Plant | 200 | 150,000 | 1990 |

**Key numbers:**
- Annual revenue: €450 million
- Annual CO₂ emissions: 4 million tons
- Regional tax contribution: €8 million/year
- Total workers: 500

---

## Why the Transition Must Happen

**Climate regulations:** EU law requires 55% emissions reduction by 2030. Coal plants must close.

**Economics:** Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal. Solar and wind cost €25-45 per MWh; coal costs €65-150 per MWh.

**Investor pressure:** Major shareholders demand climate action and better ESG performance.

---

## The Resources Available

**Company investment:** €3 billion approved by the Board of Directors

**Government fund:** €500 million from regional authorities

**Total available:** €3.5 billion

**Planned renewables:**
- Wind farms: 450 MW (3 facilities)
- Solar installations: 350 MW (5 facilities)
- Total: 800 MW renewable capacity

---

## Timeline Constraints

Building renewable energy takes time:

| Project Type | Development Time |
|--------------|------------------|
| Wind farm | 24-30 months |
| Solar installation | 18-24 months |
| Battery storage | 18-24 months |

**Realistic transition timeline:** 5-7 years minimum

Faster timelines risk power outages for 350,000 homes.

---

## The Stakeholders

Six groups have stakes in this transition:

| Group | Main Interest |
|-------|---------------|
| **PowerShift Management** | Financial viability, reputation, timeline |
| **Workers Union** | Job security, fair support packages |
| **Community Coalition** | Local economy, public services |
| **Environmental Alliance** | Fast closure, clean-up, health |
| **Regional Government** | Balance all interests, climate targets |
| **Investor Coalition** | Returns, ESG performance |

---

## Key Tensions

**Speed vs. Safety:** Climate urgency demands fast action, but rushed transitions cause power outages.

**Jobs vs. Environment:** Workers need time to transition; environmentalists want quick closure.

**Costs vs. Support:** Generous worker packages cost money that could go to renewables.

**Local vs. Global:** Communities want local benefits; investors want cost efficiency.

---

## What Success Looks Like

A good outcome includes:
- Transition timeline that maintains power reliability
- Fair support for affected workers
- Investment in local communities
- Strong environmental restoration
- Financially viable for the company

**No single group gets everything they want.** The goal is finding workable compromises that most parties can accept.
