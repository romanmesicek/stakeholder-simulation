# Staying in Role — Quick Reference

## Ground Rules

1. **Stay in character** during all negotiations
2. **Respect time limits** set by the facilitator
3. **Your constraints are real** — honour them
4. **No agreement is a valid outcome** — don't force consensus
5. **Listen as much as you advocate**

## Role-Playing Tips

### Before Negotiations
- Read your role card thoroughly
- Identify your top 3 priorities
- Know your constraints (what you cannot accept)
- Consider potential allies and opponents

### During Negotiations
- Speak from your stakeholder's perspective ("We need..." not "I think...")
- Reference your stakeholder's interests and concerns
- Use the facts and figures from your role card
- Take notes on offers and proposals

### Managing Conflict
- Disagreement is expected and valuable
- Attack positions, not people
- Look for creative trade-offs
- Remember: real negotiations often fail
